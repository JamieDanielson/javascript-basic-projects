JavaScript Basic Projects - updated with personal touch

From John Smilga's [javascript-basic-projects](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects).

John's original projects are found here (<https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/>)

I am going through these projects and then updating with my own changes to expand upon them.
