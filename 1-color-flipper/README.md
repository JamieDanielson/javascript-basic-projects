# Color Inspiration

This was originally from [John Smilga's JavaScript Basic Projects](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects).

I completed the project and then expanded upon it. Instead of having two separate pages - one for getting a random color from a specified list and one for generating a random hex value, I removed the page with colors from a specified list and created two additional buttons for generating random colors. This then became a "Color Inspiration" sort of page where you can click in each of the buttons to get three different colors.
